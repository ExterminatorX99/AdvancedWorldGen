This mod aims to make more special seeds like 1.4's drunk world, for the worthy or not the bees.

For now, it adds 4 more simple seeds :
- Random : Features a world where each block and wall type is randomized.
- Painted : Features a world where each block and wall type get a paint.
- Entropy : Features a normal world, but each dusk and dawn, a part of the world has one type of tiles and walls randomized
- Santa : Unlike the others, this seed is christmas themed.
You can select the options you want with the UI in the seed selection screen

To get the world of your dreams, you may combine multiple special seeds by a comma, so "painted,santa" will be a painted christmas world.
Unlike vanilla special seeds, the true seed can be set, so you may copy a world by using its seed, you will still get the same world.
