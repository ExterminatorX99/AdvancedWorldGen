This mods aims to add options to affect heavily the world generation and what happens there while staying pretty close to the vanilla game, like the three secret seeds of Terraria.
It also includes ways to combine them with vanilla seeds so you can have both for the worthy and drunk world generation at the same time for example.
You can select the different seed option with the gear on the right of where the seed can be inputted in the world creation UI.
This mod also removes the vanilla way of triggering the secret seeds, so no seed will trigger a secret, they can only be enabled by the option UI.
