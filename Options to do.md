* ### A world where everything is a dungeon with different rooms

* ### A world where jungle spreads to the dirt, corruption, stone(making it lizhard ?)...

## Reversed world :
Main tiles are inverted : 

* Dungeon <-> Temple
* Snow <-> Desert
* Jungle <-> Mushroom
* Crimson <-> Corruption
* Lava -> Honey -> Water -> Lava

## Temple rework : 
* Temple is upside down
* Temple is 5 times bigger
* Rooms are not linear
* Traps not breakable before Golem is beaten
* Few mini temples

## Dark world :
* Everything is walled
* Light is dimmer
* Everything is considered as underground or deeper (for spawn purposes)
* Big columns with a world roof (maybe a surface at the space layer)

## Unstable world :
* World is divided in chunks and each is linked to non adjacent ones, exiting one teleports you to the other
* Would be better if say the right side of the square would be linked to the top of another and adjust the gravity with it
* Would again be better if the visual was showing the linked chunk instead of the adjacent
